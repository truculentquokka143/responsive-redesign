            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>For this assignment, we analyzed and identified flaws in an 
                existing interface.
                We also created low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes
                for various screen sizes and built a responsive website based 
                on those prototypes.

            <h2>Picking a Webpage</h2>
            <p id="interface-description">
                I picked the <a href="https://karmicgrounds.com">Karmic Grounds</a> website, which 
                is a cute little coffee shop from my hometown. I chose to redesign the homepage
                because I noticed that I couldn't access the menu anywhere on the page, and in my opinion,
                the overall mood of the website did not align with the modern and clean image of the company.
            </p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Finding Problems</h2>
            <p> I analyzed the usability of the web page using the criteria such as
                usability (e.g., including efficiency), learnability, and memorability.
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Efficiency: To check out the menu, users must download 
                        the Karmic Grounds app or select the order online option, which 
                        takes them to a different website. This is inefficient because 
                        a user can’t just go directly to the main website to check out 
                        the menu and may get discouraged by the need to do extra steps 
                        just to see what the shop offers. Once users know that they need 
                        to leave the website to browse the menu, users will recognize that they
                        don't even need to visit website anymore and favor using the app, which shows the 
                        failure of the website.</li>

                    <li>Learnability: The first time users encounter the website,
                         they may not notice the menu icon located at the top left
                          corner of the page. If they fail to notice it, they may 
                          just think that the website is just one scrolling page,
                           which makes it difficult and frustrating to jump to a 
                           specific section. Also, there is no menu section, which 
                           makes the basic task of viewing the menu impossible 
                           unless they choose to download the Karmic Grounds app.</li>
                    
                    <li>Memorability: When users revisit the website after some time and want to view the menu,
                        they will recognize immediately that the menu is not provided
                        on the website and immediately leave.</li>
                    
                    <li>Satisfaction: The website’s background is black with an 
                        intricate pattern, which makes reading the text a bit 
                        difficult at times.
                        Also there is a sticky header bar that stays as you scroll advertising 
                        the Karmic Grounds app, which gives the impression that the 
                        website is just a promotional page for the app and not a standalone website representing Karmic Grounds </li>
                </ul> 
                </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Accessibility</h2>
            <div class="acc-container">
            <div>
                <p id="acc-text"> I then used <a href="https://wave.webaim.org">WebAIM WAIVE</a> to detect possible accessibility problems.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There are 11 images missing alternative text, which means that almost every image on the 
                            website lacks text description that is crucial for users using a screen reader or for when 
                            the image fails to load.
                        </li>
                        <li>There are 7 alerts about skipped headings or possible headings, 
                            which means that the visual hierarchy is compromised and navigating is difficult.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <p>I agree that the headings are not clearly distinguished. For instance, 
                    for the experience section, the heading “The Experience” is the same size as 
                    the body for the section, which is not ideal. The only distinguishing trait 
                    between headers and the description is whether or not it is in caps or not.

            <h2>Usability Problems: Summary</h2>
            <p>The current Karmic Grounds website seems like an advertisement to download the 
                Karmic Grounds app, which has the menu, information about the rewards program, 
                news and offers, and ordering options. The website simply isn’t on par with the app and 
                doesn’t stand alone as its own application that customers can use to discover Karmic 
                Ground’s products (specifically their menu items). There are also some underlying accessibility issues with the interface that should be fixed to 
                make the experience enjoyable for all users.
                </p>
                <p>
                Based on these concerns, my goal was to improve the design of the Karmic Grounds homepage 
                so that it can stand on its own as a website representing the Karmic Grounds brand and all it has to offer.
